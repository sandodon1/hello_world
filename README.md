A Hello World repository for JavaScript class

I am Don and this is my first real attempt to use GitHub. After working as a software developer for Boeing for many years, I am looking to update and broaden my software skills by taking a JavaScript certificate course and in the first class we are learning about Git. I have completed a few other certificates, including Java and Android Application Development, where we learned a bit about Git and GitHub, but really just scratched the surface.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, playing soccer and craft beer.
